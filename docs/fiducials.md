# Fiducials tool

You can use the built-in `pti` (painted-turtle interactive) script to identify the coordinates of real-world objects in the canvas space. This is useful for calibrating your plotter to the real world, or for identifying the location of objects in your workspace.

```bash
uv run pti
# Or with an optional output file:
uv run pti -o output.txt
```
